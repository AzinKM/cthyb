Benchmarks
==========

This page should contain plots and figures and results that have been obtained and that
give information about the speed, the efficiency, correctness, etc. of the code.

5-band results
--------------

It would be good to have a plot of a :math:`G(\tau)` here with an indication of
how many processors and how long it took to get it.


Histogram of subspace dimensions
--------------------------------

To be put here for a typical 5-band calculation. Could be done for 3 bands too.


Comparisons with old matrix code
--------------------------------

One can use the new code purely with matrices. In that case it can be directly
compared to the old solver. This way one can compare efficiencies and especially
figure how useful caching the trace can be.
